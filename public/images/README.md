# AI Processor Image Instructions

Please add an image of a processor with "AI" text to this directory with the filename `ai-processor.jpg`.

## Requirements:
1. High resolution (minimum 1920x1080px)
2. Shows a processor/circuit board with "AI" text visible
3. Dark enough to allow white text overlay to be readable
4. Not too busy - should serve as a background without distracting from content

## Suggested Sources:

## After Adding:
Once you've added the image, the background will automatically appear on your homepage.

## Image Adjustments:
The image has been configured with:
- Overlay with improved contrast (bg-gradient-to-b from-black/80 via-black/60 to-black/80)
- Additional overlay for better text readability (bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-[2px])

These settings ensure the background image doesn't overpower the content while still being visible.
